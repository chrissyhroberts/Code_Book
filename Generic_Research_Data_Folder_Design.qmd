# Research study folder template

Stored in the folder data/ there are two sets of folders designed to be used as a start point for data management in research and trials. I've found these useful for organising myself in a standardised way and the trial folders are appropriate to a trial master file.

### Research study

```{r}
fs::dir_tree(path = "data/Generic_Research_Folders/" , recurse = TRUE)
```

## Clinical trial

```{r}
fs::dir_tree(path = "data/Generic_Trial_Folders/" , recurse = TRUE)
```
