title: "Text to Speech in R"

## Background

This is a simple bit of script that reaches in to the linux/OS-X system and runs a text to speech function.

It may have some practical benefits. I quite like to use it to tell me that a long running script has finished.

## Define Functions

```{r}
speakr <- function(message="hello, world")
{
  if(.Platform$OS.type == "unix"){system(paste("say ",message,sep=""))}
	else {system(paste("echo ",message,"|ptts",sep=""))}
}	



```

## Example

```{r}
# usage examples

speakr()
speakr("Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?")
```
