# Comic formats to PDF

This tool converts `.cbz` (ZIP-based) and `.cbr` (RAR-based) comic book files into PDF format. It extracts images from comic archives and merges them into a single PDF file. The tool supports batch processing, allowing you to convert all `.cbz` and `.cbr` files in a directory.
