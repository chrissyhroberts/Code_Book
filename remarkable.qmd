# Remarkable 2 / Paper Pro Template Hacks

I'm a user of the excellent \[Remarkable\](remarkable.com) e-ink devices.

In most respects the Remarkable does everything it should do, but falls short because it doesn't allow you to use custom templates.

The system is however largely based on open-source software, which makes the remarkable hackable and modifiable.

This \[external repo\](<https://github.com/chrissyhroberts/remarkable_2_and_paper_pro_custom_templates>) provides some ways to add your own templates and sleep screens to your remarkable.

Like this **sleep screen**, which is more fun than the blank screen they ship with.
